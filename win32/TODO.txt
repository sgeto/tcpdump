Monitoring DNS Queries with tcpdump

tcpdump -vvv -s 0 -l -n port 53

This outputs each DNS query and response on a separate line

−l Make stdout line buffered. Useful if you want to see the data while capturing it. E.g.,
tcpdump −l | tee dat
or
tcpdump −l > dat & tail −f dat
Note that on Windows,‘‘line buffered’’ means ‘‘unbuffered’’, so that WinDump will write each
character individually if −l is specified.
